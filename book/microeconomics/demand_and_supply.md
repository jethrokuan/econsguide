## Demand and Supply
I assume you've read this topic before, so my focus here is clarifying doubts and making concepts clear rather than going through them from start to end. One might notice that for oligopolies, there is no such thing as a "market price". How do we then do demand and supply analyses for markets like oligopolies and monopolies when there aren't the corresponding supply curve?

The simple answer is, __you can't__.

__The markets examined with the demand and supply model are assumed to be perfectly competitive__. But don't go telling cambridge examiners when they ask questions that their question is invalid; just follow the requirements of the question. This scenario only happens when the examiners are trying to test both market structure and demand and supply at once, so forgive them.

### Demand

#### Law of Demand
> The law of demand states that when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded will fall. This results in the _downward sloping_ demand curve.

There are two effects that account for the law of demand.

1. __Income Effect__: People will feel poorer as the purchasing power of their real income has dropped, resulting in decreased consumption
2. __Subsitution Effect__: Other goods will now appear relatively cheaper, and people will switch over to these alternatives
