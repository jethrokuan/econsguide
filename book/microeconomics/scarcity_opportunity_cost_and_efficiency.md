## Scarcity, Opportunity Cost and Economic Efficiencies

### Scarcity
Scarcity means that society has __limited resources__ and __unlimited wants__. Economics, in turn, is the study of choices individuals make and its consequences.

Our society faces the scarcity of four resources:

1. __Labour__: time humans spend in producing goods and services
2. __Capital__
    a. __Physical__:  physical goods; machinery, equipment etc.
    b. __Human__: skills/knowledge of the labour force
3. __Land__: physical space on which production takes place
4. __Entrepeneurship__: ability and willingness to combine the above 3 resources

### Opportunity Cost
Opportunity cost is defined as the following:

> __Opportunity cost__ is the cost of an alternative that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain action.

Such costs come in different forms, but under either __explicit costs__ or __implicit costs__. Explicit costs refer to the _dollars sacrificed_, while implicit costs refer to the _value of something sacrificed when no direct payment is made_.

All production carries with it an opportunity cost, because resources are allocated into producing a good, which could be allocated to the production of other goods.

#### The Law of Opportunity Cost

> __The Law of Opportunity Cost__ states that the more of something we produce, the greater the opportunity cost of producing it.

This results in the concave shape of the PPC curves.

Opportunity costs are however not easily calculated, for it __requires time and information__. Opportunity cost also __varies with circumstance__, and a context is required for such calculations. This can lead to implicit costs varying widely in different circumstances.

### Rational Choices
Choices involve the weighing of the benefits of any activity against its opportunity cost. That is consumers, consuming a particular amount of a good by considering the marginal costs and marginal benefits of the good. You will get more familiar with this concept in [market failure](#mf).

### Efficiency, and the PPC
PPC stands for Production Possibilities Curve. It is a curve showing all combinations of 2 goods (Axis labelled "Good A" and "Good B") that can be produced with the resources and technology currently available.

Any point on the curve (Points B,C and D) indicate that the economy has achieved __productive efficiency__. Point A lies inside the curve, so if the economy operates at point A, the economy is __productive inefficient__. Point X lies outside the curve, and this point is unattainable with the economy's current amount of resources and technology. Over time, the production possibilities of a nation are likely to increase. Investment in new plant and machinery will increase the stock of capital; new raw materials may be discovered; technological advances are likely to take place; through education and training, labour is likely to become more productive. This growth in potential output is illustrated by an outward shift in the production possibility curve. This will then allow actual output to increase.

The microeconomic goal of an economy is to achieve efficiency, but only productive efficiency can be illustrated with the PPC curve. Whether allocative efficiency has been achieved (where on the PPC the point lies) can only be determined through other means. Other efficiencies that the economy is concerned about include dynamic efficiency and X-efficiency, but these will be discussed in greater detail later on.
