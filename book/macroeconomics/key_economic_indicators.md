## Key Economic Indicators
Just as how doctors require tools like thermometers to give a quantitative measure of the health of an individual, economic indicators are required to describe and assess the macroeconomy. These economic indicators are used to measure _relative_ economic performance between countries(__international comparison__), or comparing the economic performance of a single country as time progresses (__intertemporal comparison__).

### Size of the Economy

Economists use the concept of __national income__ to measure the size of the economy. National income is proportional to the amount of economy activity within the country, and therefore ceteris paribus, the greater the national income, the greater the level of economic activity. 

#### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
> Nominal GDP is the sum of the market value of all _final_ goods and services produced _within a country_ over a given period of time (usually a year)
> $$GDP = \sum{P_x\times Q_x}$$

The goods and services here are final goods and services, because the inclusion of semi-finished goods would result in a miscalculation, specifically __double counting__, where the market value of semi-finished goods are included along with the market value of the its final form.

As the term "domestic" implies, this number will only include economic activity (production) within the country. Whether the goods produced within the country are consumed by local or foreign households however does not matter.

#### Real GDP
However, a nominal GDP increase does not necessarily indicate a healthy economy. Notice there are two terms in the formulation of GDP, $P_x$ and $Q_x$. This would mean that a GDP increase could be solely due to an increase in general price levels, and not output levels. 

To better determine if economic growth was a result of increase in output levels, economists use the concept of __real GDP__. This is achieved by multiplying the value of output each year with the prices of those goods _in some predetermined year_. This year is known as the __base year__, and the price prevailing at that period of time is the __base year price__ of the good.

$$\text{Real GDP} = \sum{P_{byp}\times Q_x}$$

#### Gross National Product (GNP)
While GDP measure the market value of final goods and services _produced within the country_, the GNP measures the market value of final goods and services _produced by citizens of the country_, __regardless of where they reside__.

$$\text{GNP} = \text{GDP} - \text{net factor (property) income from abroad}$$

The concept of GNP is important when many of the citizens of a country reside overseas, of which the income they generate overseas are repatriated to back to their home country. The value of the GDP will then be vastly different from that of the value of the GNP.

#### Net National Product (NNP)
The NNP is used by economists to recognise that some of the capital stock used suffer from wear and tear and require replacement. Capital stocks include items such as machinery and equipment. This would mean that the NNP would provide a better indication of the increase in productive capacity.

$$\text{NNP} = \text{GNP} - \text{Depreciation}$$

Depreciation is also sometimes termed as __capital consumption__ and __replacement investment__.

#### Making Comparisons
##### Intertemporal Comparisons
###### Measuring Economic Growth
To measure economic growth (this phrase is already a first derivative;"change in economic activity over time"), economists calculate the _percentage change_ of GDP:

$$\% \Delta \text{GDP}_x = \left(\frac{\text{GDP}_x-\text{GDP}_{x-1}}{\text{GDP}_{x-1}}\right)\times 100\%$$

#### Accounting for Population Changes
While GDP is an indication of the total economic activity of the country, it is not indicative of the amount of income received per person in the population on average. This information is important as it gives economists an idea of how much "richer" each individual on average is. To account for the population changes, economists use the concept of __GDP per capita__.

Mathematically we write:

$$\text{GDP per capita} = \frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{population}}$$

We can approximate changes in per capita GDP by differentiating both sides by time.

$$\frac{d\text{GDP per capita}}{dt} \approx \frac{\frac{d\text{GDP}}{dt}\times\text{population} - \text{GDP}\times\frac{d\text{population}}{dt}}{\text{population}^2}$$

$$\frac{\frac{d\text{GDP per capita}}{dt}}{\text{GDP per capita}}\times 100\%\approx \frac{\frac{d\text{GDP}}{dt}\times\text{population} - \text{GDP}\times\frac{d\text{population}}{dt}}{\text{population}^2\times \frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{population}}}\times 100\%$$

Rearranging the terms, we get:

$$\% \Delta \text{GDP per capita} \approx \% \Delta\text{GDP} -\% \Delta\text{population}$$
