## Market Failure

### What is Market Failure?
Market Failure is defined as the following:

> Market Failure is the failure of the __free market__ to allocate resources in a fashion that __maximises societal welfare__.

This is the justification for government intervention. The very fact that the free market is failing to maximise societal welfare means that the government has to step in and take measures, which will be explored later, to correct the market failure.

### Causes of Market Failure
Market failure occurs because of various reasons, all of which fall under these broad-based categories:

1. Public Goods
2. Positive and Negative Externalities
3. Merit and Demerit Goods
4. Immobility of Factors
5. Market Dominance
6. Inequity of income and wealth

_Note: "Inequality" is a mathematical concept ($\geq$ and what not), while "inequity" is the social/moral concept, and the latter is what economics in this context wants_
