    <h3><a href="#what-is-market-failure">What is Market Failure?</a></h3>
    <p>Market Failure is defined as the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Market Failure is the failure of the <strong>free market</strong> to allocate resources in a fashion that <strong>maximises societal welfare</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is the justification for government intervention. The very fact that the free market is failing to maximise societal welfare means that the government has to step in and take measures, which will be explored later, to correct the market failure.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="causes-of-market-failure" class="level3">
    <h3><a href="#causes-of-market-failure">Causes of Market Failure</a></h3>
    <p>Market failure occurs because of various reasons, all of which fall under these broad-based categories:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Public Goods</li>
    <li>Positive and Negative Externalities</li>
    <li>Merit and Demerit Goods</li>
    <li>Imperfect Information</li>
    <li>Immobility of Factors</li>
    <li>Inequity of income and wealth</li>
    <li>Market Dominance</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note: &quot;Inequality&quot; is a mathematical concept (<span class="math">\(\geq\)</span> and what not), while &quot;inequity&quot; is the social/moral concept, and the latter is what economics in this context wants</em></p>
    <section id="public-goods" class="level4">
    <h4><a href="#public-goods">Public Goods</a></h4>
    <p>There are two defining characteristics of a public good: <strong>non-rivalrous</strong> and <strong>non-excludable</strong>.</p>
    <section id="non-rivalrous" class="level5">
    <h5><a href="#non-rivalrous">Non-rivalrous</a></h5>
    <p>A good is non-rivalrous when <em>an individual consumer does not reduce the quantity of the good available to other consumers</em>. That is, the marginal cost of providing the good to one more consumer is 0. In mathematical terms <span class="math">\(MC=0\)</span>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Make a mental note that this MC is not the marginal cost of <em>producing</em> the good, but the marginal cost of <em>consuming</em> the good.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Examples of non-rivalrous goods are: radio signals, light from street lamps etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="non-excludable" class="level5">
    <h5><a href="#non-excludable">Non-excludable</a></h5>
    <p>Non-excludable goods are either <em>impossible</em> or <em>prohibitively costly</em> to exlucde non-payers from consuming the good. That is, the goods are excludable <em>NOT by choice</em>. For example, a library can easily be made excludable by prohibiting people from entering, so a library is not a public good.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="how-public-goods-lead-to-market-failure" class="level5">
    <h5><a href="#how-public-goods-lead-to-market-failure">How Public Goods Lead to Market Failure</a></h5>
    <p>The combination of non-rivalry and non-excludability leads to what is famously known as the <strong>free rider problem</strong>. Since it is impossible to exclude someone from consuming a good, rational consumers will choose to free ride from someone who possesses the good. Because the good is not &quot;used up&quot; upon free-riding, the ability to free ride the good can persist in the long run.</p>
    <p>This results in all consumers unwilling to pay for the good. i.e.</p>
    <p><span class="math">\[P=MC=0\]</span></p>
    <p>Prices can be seen as the value the consumer places on the good in question, but the price signal sent by consumers would then be zero in the case of public goods. The price signal does not reflect the value the consumers place on the good (which is a positive price), and this incorrect signal results in the failure of the price mechanism.</p>
    <p>This is illustrated in the graph below: <img src="images/pg.jpg" alt="Public Goods" /></p>
    <p>The price signal transmitted is the orange line, while the actual value the consumers place on the good is given by the MSB/MPB curve. Assuming no externalities, social optimum quantity is where the MSC and MSB curves intersect. As we can see the quantity consumed is now 0, an underconsumption. For each additional unit from 0 till <span class="math">\(Q_{SO}\)</span>, the marginal benefits of consuming the good outweigh the marginal costs. There is thus a deadweight-loss due to underconsumption, given by the red shaded area.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="policies" class="level5">
    <h5><a href="#policies">Policies</a></h5>
    <section id="direct-provision" class="level6">
    <h6><a href="#direct-provision">Direct Provision</a></h6>
    <p>By having the government the government produce public goods, the decision to produce and consume the goods are now in the hands of the government. The production of public goods will be in the amount which the government <em>perceives</em> to be social optimal quantity, financed by taxpayers money.</p>
    <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
    <p>Direct provision might lead to the production of a good which should never have been produced in the first place. Less drastically, it is difficult for the government to determine the social optimum quantity for production, and it produces the public good at the level it deems to be social optimal. This could result in over/under-production of the good, that might even result in a greater deadweight-loss. This is an example of government failure.</p>
